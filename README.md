## ‚öôÔ∏è Running locally for development

Start cloning Akuse:

```
git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/Akuse.git
```

Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
As Redirect Uri, you can insert `akuse://index,https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin` (these are two space seprated uri) and it should work.
Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.js file with a structure like this:

```
module.exports = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    redirectUriAppImage:"",
    clientSecret: ""
}
```

Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.

```bash
# Example:
module.exports = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: "akuse://index",
    redirectUriAppImage: "https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin",
    clientSecret: "iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv"
}
```

Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):

```
npm install
```

To start, run:

```
npm start
```

## ‚ö† How to Log-In in development & AppImage

In development and AppImage, the Log-In redirect doesn't work since the app is not packed/installed and the Redirect Uri doesn't find it on your machine. If you need to work with an authenticated instance. 
### Follow  steps:
1. open the app using one of the method e.g.
    ```
    npm start
    ```
      OR
    ```
    ./path/to/app.AppImage
    ```
2. Now click on the login button and authenticate in the browser. you will get redirect to website like this:-

    ![1709734157317](image/README/1709734157317.png)

    copy this code in the input box and close the tab.
3. Now close the app and run it with flag `--login` followd by code e.g:- 
    - developement mode 
      ```js
        npm start -- --login def50200211627a77c5ecb3ac3f9eef26d955...........
      ```
    - AppImage
      ```js
        ./path/to/akuse.AppImage --login def50200211627a77c5ecb3ac3f9eef26d955...........
      ```
**NOTE:** This is not needed in Installed App.
